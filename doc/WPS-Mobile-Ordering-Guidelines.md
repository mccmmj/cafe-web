LOGO REQUIREMENTS: OPERATOR LISTING

The visual appearance of your venue and the balance of branding messages
(size, quantity, placement and relative weight) must reinforce your venue name
or logo as the primary means of identification. This will help set customer
expectations and contribute to a better experience by ensuring customers
understand that your venue serves Starbucks® coffee but is not a Starbucks®
retail location.

If the WPS Starbucks® logo or wordmark are used on operator mobile ordering
app, the operator's name or logo must be present with WPS Starbucks® clearly
secondary.

Follow the requirements below to reinforce the relationship (e.g., it’s Daylight
Café first, and We Proudly Serve Starbucks® plays a supporting role) is key. If
there isn’t space to include both your logo and WPS Starbucks® logo, you can
spell both out.  Your venue name must come first and carry larger font size
followed by We Proudly Serve Starbucks®. Do not abbreviate, do not just list
Starbucks.

For placement on mobile app the and using logos operator logo must be at last
2x larger than the WPS Starbucks® logo or wordmark.

CORRECT USAGE

INCORRECT USAGE

The WPS logo cannot
come first and cannot
be larger than the
proportions indicated

The WPS logo must
hold its own space
apart from your logo
and may not be
incorporated into your
design.
