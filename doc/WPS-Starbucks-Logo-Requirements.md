WE PROUDLY SERVE STARBUCKS® LOGO & BRAND REQUIREMENTS

Our We Proudly Serve Starbucks® program provides our operators the opportunity to offer a familiar selection of
globally loved Starbucks beverages in your environment.

To do this, we provide operators with clearly defined beverage and brand solutions, which have been designed and
aligned with Starbucks® Coffee Company. It is imperative that your operation is represented by your identity first (the
café name) with the We Proudly Serve Starbucks®  logo/brand secondary. Following the requirements outlined in this
resource guide will ensure a successful brand experience for both you and your consumers.

STEPS TO SUCCESSFUL WE PROUDLY SERVE STARBUCKS® LOGO REQUIREMENTS USAGE

The Starbucks Siren logo may not be used independently of the “We Proudly Serve” text.  The logo
lock up can never be separated.

Ensure your location identity or logo is always the primary/most prominent identity. This will help
set customer expectations and contribute to a better experience by ensuring customers understand that
your venue serves Starbucks®  coffee but is not a Starbucks® retail location.

Re-creation of the We Proudly Serve Starbucks® logo for any stand-alone branded signage use in
your operation is not permitted. Operators can leverage existing branded signage provided by Nestle
Coffee Partners Solutions Lab for logo signage in your operation.

Ensure the amount of We Proudly Serve Starbucks® branded signage does not exceed the required
allotment. Maximum branded We Proudly Serve Starbucks® signage instances per location includes:

1 Blade Sign – used as a directional way finder for your operation
1 Wall Sign – used with primary location identity to signify WPS Starbucks program
1-3 Menu Board panels
2 Poster Frames
2 Counter Cards

Review and follow approved Do and Don’ts when leveraging the We Proudly Serve Starbucks® logo to
promote, communicate, and market your location.

Ensure you are leveraging our Operator Brand Experience Toolkit on our Customer Portal.
Logo Requirements, Menu Board Templates (digital and printed) and approved photo assets for
operators to leverage are available to download.

To ensure requirements are met, all additional assets, marketing and communications created by the
operator and using the We Proudly Serve Starbucks ® logo must be approved by Nestle Coffee Partners
Solutions Lab and submitted for review to FS Marketing for Solutions Lab.

Full details for each of the above requirements are
documented on the following pages

PRIMARY OPERATOR IDENTITY RELATIONSHIP

The visual appearance of your venue and the balance of branding messages (size, quantity, placement
and relative weight) must reinforce your venue name or logo as the primary means of identification.
This will help set customer expectations and contribute to a better experience by ensuring customers
understand that your venue serves Starbucks®  coffee but is not a Starbucks®  retail location.

If the WPS Starbucks®  logo or wordmark are used on operator created materials, the operator's name or
logo must be present with WPS Starbucks® clearly secondary. Follow the requirements below to
reinforce the relationship (e.g., it’s Daylight Café first, with WPS Starbucks playing a supporting role).

CORRECT branding

INCORRECT usage examples

Pieces larger than 8.5” x 11”: The operator logo
must be at least 4x larger than the WPS Starbucks®
logo or wordmark. Size is determined by overall area -
height & width. Ex. Menu Boards, Posters

The WPS Starbucks® logo cannot come first and cannot be
larger than the proportions indicated.

To promote your relationship with Starbucks while setting appropriate customer expectations, please
ensure you’re following approved We Proudly Serve Starbucks® logo requirements when setting up your
location. Correct ratio sizing of the We Proudly Serve Starbucks®  logo to your location’s logo – along with
placement in the café is key. This ensures customers approaching your venue understand that it serves
Starbucks® coffee but is not a Starbucks® retail location. This may help to avoid confusion over
promotional offerings or payment features that are specific to Starbucks® retail stores, and ultimately
contribute to a better experience for your customers.

Ensure the amount of We Proudly Serve Starbucks® branded signage doesn’t exceed the required
allotment. The maximum branded We Proudly Serve Starbucks® signage instances per location includes:

1 Blade Sign – used as a directional way finder for your operation
1 Wall Sign – used with primary location identity to signify WPS Starbucks program
