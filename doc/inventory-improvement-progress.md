## Notes
- Report will be updated as each item moves to in-progress/done and when code changes land.
- PO modal: quick-add collapse and reorder prefill done; out-of-stock exclusion added to email send flow and can be toggled post-send/at receipt.
- Unit cost calculator & history — acceptance criteria:
  - Editable unit cost field available in inventory detail and PO line editor, with inline calculator to derive unit cost from pack price and pack_size. ✅
  - Auto-normalize costs to per-unit when pack_size > 1; display both pack and unit views when pack item selected. ✅
  - Persist cost changes with timestamp, user, source (manual edit, PO line, invoice confirm), and previous value. ✅
  - Surface recent cost history (last 5 changes) in inventory detail drawer and PO line hover, with ability to revert to a prior value. ✅
  - Invoice confirmation writes cost history when it updates unit_cost; must not regress current_stock. ✅
  - Validation: unit_cost >= 0, pack_cost >= 0; prevents saving if required data missing. ✅
- Invoice resilience — current work: upload endpoint now reuses/replaces an existing invoice (same supplier + number) when it is not confirmed, resetting file, parsing state, and invoice items so re-uploads after unlink do not fail on uniqueness. Confirmed invoices remain protected.
